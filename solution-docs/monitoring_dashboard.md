# Add monitoring app to the solution, Shortening App (FINN)

## Introduction
If I have more time I will do the following:

* Use kubernetes wih helm to deploy the solution
* Use a database to store the short urls
* Use prometheus to monitor the solution and grafana to visualize the metrics.
* Use a CI/CD nd Cloud Build tool to deploy the solution.
* User GCP as Clou provider.
